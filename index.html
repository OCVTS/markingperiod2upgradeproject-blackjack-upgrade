                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>My project is the card game Blackjack, made with Phaser. At it's current state, all buttons used are placeholders for when I get better button assests to use. It has a simply start screen with a dark mode button, and the game itself has two reset buttons, one to just play another round and one to go back to the start screen. As of right now, all scoring is done by the player themselves, as well as playing for the dealer.</p>

                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>The development of my project did not go much like how I had planned it. The code was originally written in Python, and it was a text-based game in the console. I thought upgrading it would simply be replacing any print or input statements with some Phaser code, but after actually learning Phaser, it was not so simple. I ended up having only using a small portion of the original code, so while the game is upgraded in a sense, many features that existed in the original have yet to be added. The visuals added or worth it, though, as they're almost exactly what I had envisioned for my game.</p>
